<p>
    Building Information Modelling is a parametric ,3D model process for creating information on a construction project across the project life cycle.One of the most important output of this process is that we get a digital description of every aspect of the built asset. This model helps in assembling the information in the collaborative way and updates it at each and every stages of the project.<br><br>
    BIM brings together all of the information about every component of a building, in one place. It makes it possible for anyone to access that information for any purpose, e.g. to integrate different aspects of the design more effectively and for controlling the progress in construction site like if the building is constructed it has several elements like door,plate,slab,window etc,so it is possible to mark the progress of all the elements using BIM.In this way, the risk of mistakes or discrepancies is reduced, and abortive costs are minimized.<br><br>
    Thus BIM ensures good communication between different stakeholders. It also helps in increasing client satisfaction ,since there is more effective communication.Due to better visualization the design can be easily communicated to non-technical clients.since all the data is stored at one place so it becomes more easy for the client who enters the project in between,in order to get a clear idea or picture of the construction process going on.(i.e the status of various elements at the site)BIM also helps in automating the quantity extraction process.Different design options and what impact they are going to have on the cost can be estimated easily with less effort and within less time.
