An application to track the building elements throughout its construction life-cycle
Building Infrastructure Management (BIM) is a parametric, 3D model process for creating information on a construction 
project across the project life cycle. One of the most important outputs of this process is a digital description of 
every aspect of the built asset. This model helps in assembling the information in a collaborative way and updates 
it at each and every stage of the project.

BIM brings together all of the information about every component of a building, in one place. It makes it possible for
anyone to access that information for any purpose, e.g. to integrate different aspects of the design more effectively 
and for controlling the progress in construction site like if the building is constructed it has several elements 
like door, plate, slab, window, etc. So it is possible to mark the progress of all the elements using BIM. 
In this way, the risk of mistakes or discrepancies is reduced and abortive costs are minimized.

Thus BIM ensures good communication between different stakeholders. It also helps in better client satisfaction, 
since there is more effective communication. Due to better visualization, the design can be easily understandable 
by non-technical clients. Since all the data is stored in one place, it becomes more easy for the client who enters 
the project in between, to get a clear idea of the construction process going on (i.e., the status of various elements 
at the site). BIM also helps in automating the quantity extraction process. Different design options and the impact
they are going to have on the cost can be estimated with less effort and in less time.
